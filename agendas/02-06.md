## Binary Tree Traversals

There are 3 different ways to go through binary trees.

* In-order traversal (Infix)

	* Go to the left node
	* Process the current node
	* Go to the right node

* Pre-order traversal (Prefix)

	* Process the current node
	* Go to the left node
	* Go to the right node

* Post-order traversal (Postfix)

	* Go to the left node
	* Go to the right node
	* Process the current node

## Visitor pattern

Nodes have an accept method that call the visitor's visit method.
The Visitor has a visit method that does stuff. :-)

## Searching

How do we search a BST in code?

## Abstract Data Types

A type where the implementation can vary. It's an interface.

* Stack - the Last thing In is the First thing Out (LIFO). Redundancy is ok
* Queue - the First thing In is the First thing Out (FIFO). Redundancy is ok
* Set - a collection of unique items in no particular order
* Bag - a collection of items in no particular order (Redundancy is ok)
* Map (Dictionary) - a unique key maps to a value.
