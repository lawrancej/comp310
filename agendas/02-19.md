Midterm concepts
----------------

## Abstract Data Types

* Stack - the Last thing In is the First thing Out (LIFO). Redundancy is ok
* Queue - the First thing In is the First thing Out (FIFO). Redundancy is ok
* Set - a collection of unique items in no particular order
* Bag - a collection of items in no particular order (Redundancy is ok)

    This is a set: {"Hello", "World"}
    This is not a set (but it is a bag): {"Hello", "Hello", "World"}

* Map (Dictionary) - a unique key maps to a value.

## Big O (runtime complexity)

* O(1) best
* O(log n) what does that mean?
* O(n!) worst

## Linked Lists

## Binary trees / search trees

## Graphs

* Breadth first search / depth first search
